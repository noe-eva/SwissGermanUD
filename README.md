# Universal Dependency Parsing for Swiss German

This repository presents work on Universal Dependency Parsing for Swiss German, which has been done as part of the Master's Thesis [Parsing Approaches for Swiss German](http://www.cl.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:cdad4255-ddd4-4071-a706-491e75085339/aepli_noemi_1990.pdf) at the [Institute for Computational Linguistics](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/en.html) at the University of Zurich. 

The provided resources consist of 100 Swiss German sentences, manually annotated with part-of-speech tags and universal dependencies. 

[NOAH's Corpus of Swiss German Dialects](https://noe-eva.github.io/NOAH-Corpus/) was used as a resource for the Swiss German part-of-speech tagging process - a process preliminary to parsing.
