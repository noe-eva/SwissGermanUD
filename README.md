# Universal Dependency Parsing for Swiss German

This repository contains 100 Swiss German sentences, manually annotated with part-of-speech tags and universal dependencies. It was created as part of the Master's Thesis [Parsing Approaches for Swiss German](http://www.cl.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:cdad4255-ddd4-4071-a706-491e75085339/aepli_noemi_1990.pdf) at the Institute for Computational Linguistics at the University of Zurich.

The thesis has been presented and [published](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2226/paper1.pdf) at the [SwissText Conference 2018](https://www.swisstext.org/).
